# Veracity Authentication Demonstration

**Veracity is a constantly evolving platform and the authentication flow may change in the future. The code here will be updated to reflect this.**

**Last updated: 2018.03.12**

This .net core application shows a quick example on how to perform authentication against the Veracity B2C tenant and retrive an authorization token in order to call the Veracity API. It uses

## Quick start

Getting started is simple! To run this sample you will need:

To install .NET Core for your operation system by following the instructions at [dot.net/core](http://dot.net/core).
An Internet connection

### Step 1: Register your application

Go the Veracity for Developers site and log in. In your developer progile you can register new applications. When you register the applciation redirectUri,please add /signin-oidc as the suffix.


### Step 2: Configure the application

When your application is created, copy the client id , client secrets, redirectUri into the appsettings.json file

### Step 5: Run the application

Once all the above steps are completed all that is left is to start the application. Open a terminal or command line in the root folder of the application on your drive and run:

```
dotnet run
```

Go to https://localhost:3000

Note that you will need to include the https 

## Overview

The authentication process can be complex to grasp at first. We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with how the OpenIDConnect flow works if you plan to work with the Veracity APIs. See [Understand the OpenIDConnect control flow in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code) for details.

This application consists of several files including javascript, html and css. The files primarily concerned with authentication and authorization are: 

- `Startup.cs`

If you are only concerned with how to perform authentication these files are the ones you should have a look at. The rest are mostly for plumbing and UI, but they are kept to demonstrate a way to structure a simple app that communicates with Veracity.

The authentication process can be summed up like this:

1. User opens the page and clicks login.
2. We redirect the user to a specific url on Azure B2C and provide a set of configuration options including a request for authentication and an access token to access the Veracity API. At this point the user leaves our control and is handed over to Azure B2C.
3. Behind the scenes Azure B2C may redirect the request to ADFS in order to perform authentication. If the user logs in correctly Azure B2C will return them back to us with several pieces of information including the user identity.
4. We receive this information and store it on our server for use later. Doing so saves us from having to call back to Azure B2C on every request in order to verify the user again.
5. At this point we can use the information Azure B2C returned to us to perform requests to the Veracity API provided we requested the information to begin with.
6. Every time the user performs an action that requires a call to the Veracity API we perform this by adding the users access token to the request.
7. Once the user finishes their work they click logout.
8. We remove all our session information about the user and redirect them to Azure B2C so they can do the same.
9. Finally we redirect them to ADFS so that it can remove the final set of session cookies. At this point the user is completely signed out.

This is the process we have set up in this demo application. Check the code comments for `// Overview step #` to see where we perform code that maps to specific points in the description above.
