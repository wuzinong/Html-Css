        With stricter regulations and rising expectations from stakeholders, the
        shipping industry now needs a solution to manage and control Carbon
        Intensity Indicator (CII) performance, paired with the accurate
        accounting of carbon emissions, to facilitate EU Allowances (EUAs). From
        January 2025, this solution will also be needed to actively manage the
        FuelEU Maritime compliance balance. This is why we have developed
        Emissions Connect. This digital service enables the maritime industry to
        meet the decarbonization requirements by equipping all stakeholders with
        an efficient system to continuously monitor and manage emissions
        performance – from raw data to business control.

        At the core of Emissions Connect is seamless access to continuously
        verified emissions data and the ability to receive verified emissions
        statements on demand. Both of which are crucial for controlling the
        impact from your emissions performance. To further support your
        emissions management, Emissions Connect provides capabilities to monitor
        and simulate emissions performance with high accuracy at the fleet,
        vessel and voyage levels. With this at hand, you are well equipped to
        take sound data-driven decisions around your emissions management
        strategy and optimize your year-to-date compliance balance.
